    "description": "In 2005, the BBC relaunched Doctor Who after a 15-year absence from episodic television, with Russell T Davies, Julie Gardner, and Mal Young as executive producers, Phil Collinson as producer, and Christopher Eccleston taking the lead role of the Ninth Doctor. The revival is a continuation of the original series. The new series is formatted to a 16:9 widescreen display ratio, and a standard episode length of 45 minutes. For the first time since the 1965â€“1966 season, each episode has a title, and most stand alone as complete stories. The show also returned to its traditional Saturday evening slot.",
